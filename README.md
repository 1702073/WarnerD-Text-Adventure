### Points
90

---

### Due Date
10/11/2024

---

### Goal
To showcase your use of the fundamental Computer Science skills by creating a Text Adventure game in the console.

---

### Instructions
1. Create a Fork of this repository by clicking the 'Fork' button at the top-right of this page. Set the Repository Name to be 'LastNameFirstInitial-Text-Adventure' (without the quotes). For example, mine would be 'HerreraSturmD-Text-Adventure' (without the quotes). Click 'Create Fork'.

2. Use your preferred GitHub client (SourceTree, Bash, etc.) to clone your fork of the repository into your student folder under 'E:\VGD\YOUR_STUDENT_NUMBER'.

3. Open the project's Solution (.sln) file using Visual Studio 2022. You can now begin writing and editing code.

4. There are a multitude of tutorial videos you need to follow to learn the skills for this project. Click [this link](https://sites.google.com/mukilteo.wednet.edu/si-vgd/skills-study) and scroll down to 'Intro to Programming' to get started. I suggest watching the videos in order.

5. Every day, before you leave class, stage, commit, and push to GitHub.

### Evaluation Procedure
1. Every time you feel like you've mastered a skill up until the project is due, let me know and I will do a quick evaluation. Based on the standards below, you will be given a score from 0 - 4 on that skill. You can get a new score on any skill at any time, your grade is never set in stone and I encourage you to try and master every single skill. Your score for each skill will be recorded until the project is due.
    - No Attempt (0): The skill was not used or attempted in any way in your project.
    - Introductory (1): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.
    - Developing (2): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.
    - Proficiency (3): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.
    - Advanced (4): Definition outlined in Skills Rubric above.

2. Your final grade on the project will be based on all the individual skill grades that were recorded, added together and adjusted to be worth the number of points that the project is worth (aka, each skill will be worth an equal part of your grade relative to the number of skills assessed and how many points the project is worth). For example, if a project is worth 80 points and there are 10 skills, then each skill is worth 8 points. For that skill, you will receive a percentage of 8 points based on whether you got a 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the scale explained above. For example, if you got a 1, you'd get 2 points for that skill (since 1/4 of 8 is 2). This will be added together to determine your final grade for the project.

3. You'll be given multiple opportunities to correct your work until submission and you can always re-submit past the due date for a better grade with no penalty. Late penalties in general are not applied to assignments, instead, your professionalism grade might take a hit for late submissions. This only applies if the initial submission is late, not any following submissions to correct your work (and sometimes accentuating circumstances occur, if you let me know in advance, I will most likely be reasonable regarding lifting penalties).

4. Your final grade for the project will be rounded to the nearest whole number.

### How to Submit
Your project will be in a constant state of being 'submitted' as long as the link submitted to Schoology is correct. I recommend uploading the link to Schoology as soon as you start the project. As long as this link is correct, the most recent push to GitHub will be the most recent submission.

---

### Success Criteria
You are successful once you have shown an understanding of each skill by scoring at least a 'Proficient' on each one.

### Examples
(None yet, you are the first class to do this project. Play a Text Adventure for reference.)
